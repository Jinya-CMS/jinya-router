# Jinya Router

## Introduction

### About

Jinya Router is a small and capable router and request handler for PHP. It works by analyzing a directory for the
provided attributes and generates a static routing table. This routing table is based on the
excellent `nikic/fast-route` package. The handling of the request itself is based on the battle tested Laminas project,
but is not limited to this. You can just create the routing table and then perform the routing by yourself.

### Highlights

* Based on the super fast `nikic/fast-route` and battle tested Laminas project
* Supports PSR-15 middlewares
* Routing table generation can be changed
* Custom route support
* Bring your own request handler or use the integrated one
* PHP 8.1 and PHP 8.2 compatible
