# How does it work

You might be wondering what Jinya Router does in the background. This is easy to answer. At first, a cache file is
generated if it doesn't exist. If it exists, this step is skipped. Then the request gets handled based on the cache
file.

## Creating the cache

To create the cache, the given controller directory, in our case `__DIR__ . '/../src/App/Controller'`, is scanned for
php files. Then every php file in that directory is read and checked for classes with the php integrated tokenizer.
After the tokenizer did its job, the class gets autoloaded and via reflection analyzed. If the class has
the `Controller` attribute, then the class is identified as controller and the methods get parsed. For every method that
has a `Route` attribute a routing entry will be created. After analyzing all files in the directory, a cache file
containing a FastRoute based dispatcher is created and written to the cache directory. In our case the cache directory
resides in `__DIR__ . '/../var/cache'`.

This is how the cache file from our example looks like, first formatted and for the brave ones, unformatted

<Tabs>
  <TabItem groupId="formatting" value="formatted" label="Formatted" default>

~~~php title="var/cache/routing/jinya-router.php"
<?php
return \FastRoute\simpleDispatcher(function (\FastRoute\RouteCollector $r) {
        $r->addGroup("/", function (\FastRoute\RouteCollector $r) {
        $r->addRoute("POST", "", ["ctrl", "App\Controller\ExampleController", "postAction", []]);
    });
});
~~~

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem groupId="formatting" value="unformatted" label="Unformatted">

~~~php title="var/cache/routing/jinya-router.php"
<?php
return \FastRoute\simpleDispatcher(function (\FastRoute\RouteCollector $r) {
$r->addGroup("/", function (\FastRoute\RouteCollector $r) {
$r->addRoute("POST", "", ["ctrl", "App\Controller\ExampleController","postAction", []]);

});


});
~~~

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Handling the request

:::tip

If you want to use your own request handler, you can. Simply generate the routing table and use the generated Dispatcher yourself.

Generating the routing table is as easy as calling the function `Jinya\Router\build_routing_table`

:::

After the cache file was created successfully, it will be included by php and the `Dispatcher` is executed. Based on the result of the execution, a Laminas middleware pipe is generated and executed. If the `Dispatcher` returns a not found response, the PSR-7 Response passed to the function is returned instead.

## The response

By default Jinya Router uses Laminas Handle Runner to generate the response and directly echos it into the response SAPI stream. So no further action is needed from your side.
